# Executive Summary: IT Service Desk Analytics

## Objective
Build a production-style analytics workflow that gives IT leadership clear visibility into service desk performance, SLA risk, and operational bottlenecks. The solution covers data generation, quality controls, KPI tracking, exploratory analysis, root-cause diagnostics, forecasting, and Power BI-ready outputs for executive reporting.

## Key Insights
1. SLA performance is concentrated in specific failure pockets, not uniformly distributed across all ticket types. A limited set of categories drive a disproportionate share of breaches.
2. Recurring incident patterns are visible across category-priority combinations, indicating repeated issue classes that can be targeted with problem management and knowledge-base actions.
3. Escalation load is uneven by team. A small number of teams account for most escalation events, suggesting opportunity for triage redesign and smarter workload balancing.
4. Weekly ticket volume is stable enough for short-horizon planning. A simple baseline forecast supports practical staffing decisions for the next month.

## Recommendations
- Launch a focused “Top Recurring Issues” backlog for the highest-frequency incident signatures and assign owners from operations and platform teams.
- Introduce escalation governance using weekly team-level escalation-rate reviews, with thresholds and corrective action plans.
- Improve first-line triage using category-specific playbooks and knowledge articles for repeat issue clusters.
- Use the 4-week ticket volume forecast as a staffing input for shift coverage, with weekly re-baselining.

## Business Impact Statement
This analytics package shifts service desk reporting from descriptive dashboards to action-oriented operations intelligence. By combining KPI visibility with repeat-issue diagnostics and near-term forecasting, leaders can prioritize remediation, reduce SLA risk, and improve service reliability with measurable accountability.
